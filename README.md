I have been playing basketball for many years and also enjoy fitness, boxing, and gymnastics. In addition to sports, I have a passion for photography, I display my photography work on [my Flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/182418029@N02/). Learning to play the guitar is on my wishlist. To discover more about me, feel free to follow my Instagram.
